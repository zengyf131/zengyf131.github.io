                                    Proposed a benchmark for various differentiable renderers including physics-based renderers and rasterizers, aiming to test and compare the renderers’ capability of solving inverse problems. 
                                    Developed an inverse rendering toolkit as a universal platform for various differentiable renderers. Currently conducting experiments and preparing a comprehensive dataset.

                                    Learned Luisa, a rendering framework focusing on high-performance physics-based rendering. 
                                    Implemented a simple ray tracing renderer '<a href="https://github.com/zengyf131/nori_PT">Nori</a>', and learned GPU programming with Cuda for parallel rendering. 
                                    Developed a path-tracing renderer for Luisa, achieving a 50x to 100x acceleration compared to its CPU-based counterpart. 
                                    Currently implementing differentiable rendering algorithms on Luisa.

                                    Contributed in proposing a method to accelerate and improve the efficiency of the Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) algorithm for the problem of 3D reconstruction from sparse views. 
                                    The key idea was to reduce the redundancy by shooting much fewer rays in the multi-view volume rendering procedure, which is the base for almost all radiance fields-based methods. 
                                    Adjusted the algorithm and improved its efficiency by 20% to 50% by testing the algorithm in numerous datasets.
